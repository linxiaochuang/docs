# ManaPHP Introduction
ManaPHP is a high performance, [component-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering) PHP framework for rapidly developing modern Web applications.
Its goal is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch,
by providing a rich set of components for commonly needed tasks,
as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these components.
ManaPHP lets you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task.


## Who is ManaPHP For?

ManaPHP is a generic Web programming framework, meaning that it can be used for developing all kinds of Web applications using PHP.
Because of its component-based architecture and sophisticated caching support,
it is especially suitable for developing large-scale applications such as portals,
forums, content management systems (CMS), e-commerce projects, [RESTful Web services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer), and so on.

## Compared with Other Frameworks
If you're already familiar with another framework, you may appreciate knowing how ManaPHP compares:

* ManaPHP Like most PHP frameworks, ManaPHP implements the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern and promotes code organization based on that pattern.
* ManaPHP takes the philosophy that code should be written in a simple yet elegant way. ManaPHP will never try to over-design things mainly for the purpose of strictly following some design pattern.
* ManaPHP is a full-stack framework providing many proven and ready-to-use features: query builders for both relational databases; RESTful API development support; multi-tier caching support; and more.
* ManaPHP is extremely extensible. You can customize or replace nearly every piece of the component 's code. You can also take advantage of ManaPHP's solid extension architecture to use or develop redistributable extensions.

ManaPHP keeps a close eye on the latest Web development trends and on the best practices and features found in other frameworks and projects. The most relevant best practices and features found elsewhere are regularly incorporated into the core framework and exposed via simple and elegant interfaces.

## Requirements and Prerequisites

ManaPHP requires PHP 5.4.0+.

Using ManaPHP requires basic knowledge of [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) (OOP),
as ManaPHP is a pure OOP-based framework.
ManaPHP also makes use of the latest features of PHP, such as namespaces and traits. Understanding these concepts will help you more easily pick up ManaPHP.
